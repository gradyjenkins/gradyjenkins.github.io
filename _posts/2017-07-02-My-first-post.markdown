Hey guys. This is my first post and I'm just going to reiterate a few things. My name is Grady and I'm a professional mobile developer that specialises in iOS and Xamarin development. This blog is mainly going to feature as a resource for myself in learning new topics. 

When I learn something new, I will be writing a blog post to describe how I did it, what resources I used, what I plan on using it for, and how I will continue with it. The tech I'm most excited for recently is Apple's AR Kit and Core ML. I've never really worked with either AR or ML, so these two Apple Frameworks will be an exciting new topic for me to go over! Come back soon for the new posts.
