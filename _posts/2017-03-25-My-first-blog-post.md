My name is Grady, and this is my new blog that is powered by Github Pages and Jekyll. This is my first post here and I plan on discussing various software development topics, my hobbies, and anything else that I find interesting. The first topic I plan on discussing will be a talk given by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, called "Hammock-Driven Development".
