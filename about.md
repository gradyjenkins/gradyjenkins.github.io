Hey! My name is Grady. I'm a recent graduate of Monmouth University with a degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Physics. I'm a professional mobile developer specialising in iOS and Xamarin development. I love picking up side projects and learning new things, so if you have an idea or a project that you'd like to work on together send me an email!

This blog will be a place where I will write posts about new topics that I am going over. Some posts might not make sense but I'm hoping people will find this in the quest for knowledge. Thanks for stopping by!
